    <p>Anchor Elements</p>
    <p>To create a link in HTML, use the anchor element. An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an a tag.</p>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
    <p>Absolute Links = protocol://domain/path </p>
    <p>example = https://www.theodinproject.com/about</p>
    <p>Relative Links = do not include the domain name</p>
    <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
    <p>Image</p>
    <p>To display an image in HTML we use the img element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered, the img element is self-closing. Empth, self-closing HTML elements do not need a closing tag.</p>
    <p>Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located.</p>
    <p> Ic can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.</p>
    <p>absolute path / https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png</p>
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">
    <p>The alt attribute is used to describe an Image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers to describe shat the image is to visually impaired users.</p>
    <p>relative path / images/dog.jpg</p>
    <img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="A cute dog">
